            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The ever-evolving term "collaboration" has been interpreted many ways over the years.  With new technology emerging and advancing every day, there are more and more ways for co-workers, groups and partners to collaborate on ideas and projects.  For web developers, this is of great importance for a number of reasons.  For starters, writing and developing code is a challenging and complicated task.  With many developers working towards the same end goal, and many "hands in the cooking pot" as it were, there is a lot of room for overlapping error and no way to find the source - unless you're utilizing the programs of today; enter GitHub.  GitHub is a free, open-source service that allows multiple people to work within one repository and save multiple versions of a file to ensure that nothing is ever lost or overwritten.  Throughout the following key concepts, I aim to summarize and describe these methods and their worth.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Every program utilizes personalized and program-based elements that make it what it is; for GitHub, there are several important commands that allow a user to work with the program and get the most of its capabilities.  There are three main commands that encompass the power and prowess of what GitHub (and its users!) aim to accomplish: Add, Commit and Push.  The "add ." command adds all the files from the last revision of the document that had been changed from the previous back up, into what is called a "staging area".  The "commit -m" command "commits" a change or update to a repository, meaning its in the que; every time you save a file, GitHub creates a "snapshot" or unique ID for the revision, describing who made the change and allow that author to comment with a description of what was changed.  The "push" command, allows the changes to be pushed from the local repository and published to the remote repository.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">One important term to recognize through the discussion of GitHub and its features is "Version Control".  Version Control is the essence and crux of what we are talking about; it is the repository that houses all of the main project files to be worked and collaborated on.  Partners, groups and co-workers can check out the files (almost like a library where you are creating drafts of the books and putting them on a final shelf for publication), make their revisions and edits, and then proceed to check them back in (remember - the "commit" command).  This helps to eliminate problems incured when sharing multiple project files and stumbling over what the last edit was and who made it.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">The Many Benefits of V.C.</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When using a version control system, there are many benefits to doing so.  As aforementioned, it elimites several instances where, when using earlier and less defined programs (or even sharing via desktop) editors could possibly overwrite each other's revisions and lose tons of work - or if someone added errors into the work, it would be an absolute wild goose chase finding out where it was made!  With version control, the files in the repository cannot be overwritten, and people can work on the project files together in unison without there being a conflict.  Older versions can be reverted back to if necessary, and the common repository holds all the most recent revisions.  Even if you are not working in a group, version control provides benefits to the individual as well, and security for their files and changes.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Types of Repositories</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Within the topic of versioning control systems, there are two different types of repositories that one can utilize.  The first is a "Remote Repository", which means that all the files added to it are residing on a "remote" server that is collaborated on and shared by several users and members.  The second repository is called a "Local Repository".  This is a repository that lives on a "local" machine of one user.  There are two methods of creating a local repository if you so choose; one way is to create a whole brand new repository, or, clone an existing remote repository onto a local machine (making it local!).</p>
